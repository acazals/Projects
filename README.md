# Python-

Here are some of the python projects I worked on. Most of them are about finance and I would like to credit  Abdelkarim Abdallah (quant from StoneX group) for his linkedins posts and Fabien Fouville
(quant at Murex) with whom I did an afternoon of introduction about quantitative finance at my engineering school (Centrale Mediterranee).
