This year as a student in Centrale I took my first lessons of Object Oriented Programmation, mainly in Java here is an example of what I have been working on

here we are working on an introduction to AI :

An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that emulates the decision-making abilities of a human expert. These systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if-then rules rather than through conventional procedural code.
Key Components:

    Knowledge Base:
        The knowledge base contains domain-specific and high-quality knowledge. This knowledge is typically encoded in the form of rules, facts, and heuristics.
    Inference Engine:
        The inference engine is the core component that applies logical rules to the knowledge base to deduce new information or solve problems. It functions similarly to the reasoning process of human experts.
    User Interface:
        This is the component that allows users to interact with the expert system, providing input and receiving output. It often includes features that explain the reasoning process of the system.

How It Works:

When a user provides input to an expert system, the inference engine processes this input against the knowledge base using a set of rules. The system can make deductions and propose solutions or recommendations based on the accumulated knowledge and logic. Expert systems can also justify their conclusions by tracing the rules and knowledge applied to reach them.
