Here is the biggest project I have done : a python code that simulates the propagation of a Forest Fire in two dimensions, taking in account many parameters such as wind, the type of forest...

It includes very mathematical aspects such as Percolation,Probability (random variables), linear algebra (matrix manipulation), Informatical aspects : automatons; 
and finally a physical simulation of combustion that tackles  Numerical Resoltion of the Newton Law
